    <p>Evening is a process, a procession, the death-procession of the sun into his nighttime abode. (What is the significance that one word for for evening in Greek is &#949;&#8016;&#966;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#951;, derived from the word for &lsquo;merriment&rsquo; or &lsquo;joyous festivity&rsquo;?)
